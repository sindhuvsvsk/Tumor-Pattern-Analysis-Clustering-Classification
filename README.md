# Tumor-Pattern-Analysis-Clustering-Classification

Unsupervised ML
1.We started with labeled dataset and discarded labels to perform Unsupervised ML.
2.Perfomed TSNE and PCA reduction.
3.We performed Unsupervised ML and created cluster of data and labeled tha dataset with these clusters.

Supervised ML
1.We used newly labeled dataset for Supervised ML.
2.Split ,test and train dataset.
3.Created Confusion matrix and confusion report.


Further Experiments:
1.We perfomed extra experiments both in supervised and unsupervised ML. In Unsupervised ML we did inertia check and Silhouette score check for determining optimal number of clusters for kmeans clustering.
2.In Supervised ML we did extra mean error check,gridsearch and RSME to conclude the k value for knearest neigbhor algorithm.
